When using JavaScript with HTML, the JavaScript code can be placed in a `<script>` tag in the header or as a `<script>` tag in the body (not recommended). An alternative will be to linking it to a `<script>` tag in the header as an external file. This is highly recommended as some javascript code can go beyond 100-200 lines. These files usually have a .js extension and will get cached by the browser. The code below contains a simple program that print "Hello" to the console in the terminal.
