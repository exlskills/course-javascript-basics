Integer numbers in JavaScript represent whole numbers. They have range of values depending on the size of the memory used. For most cases, integer values can hold numbers from `-9007199254740992` to `9007199254740992`. As mentioned previously, their underlying type is a floating-point number (IEEE-754 standard). Take a look at the sample code below to learn how integers and declared and used.
