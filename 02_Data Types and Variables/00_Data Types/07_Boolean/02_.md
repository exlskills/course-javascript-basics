The variable `greaterAB` holds false because 1 is not greater than 2. The variable `equalA1` will be true because the variable `a` is holding the integer value of 1. The examples above are very simple examples of how booleans are used in JavaScript. However, statements like these are what we need to build functional programs or sites in the future, so make sure you understand why the expressions evaluate to `true` and `false` respectively.
