Strings represent a sequence of characters. They are always enclosed in either single quotes (') or double quotes ("). Starting ES6, or ECMAScript 2015, back ticks <code>\`</code> can also be used to represent strings. String can be concatenated using the `+` operator as shown in the code sample below. 

Additionally, strings are stored as Unicode, a industry standard for the encoding, representation, and handling of text expressed in most programming languages. Unicode supports all commonly used alphabets in the world, including Cyrillic, Chinese, Arabic, Greek, Spanish, English, German etc. The sample code below shows the use of Arabic, Bulgarian, and Japanese.
