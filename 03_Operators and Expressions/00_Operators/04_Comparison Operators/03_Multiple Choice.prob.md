>>Consider the following code segment:

```
let a = 5;
let b = "5";
console.log(a == b && a === b);
```

What will the code above print to the console?<<

(x) false {{Correct because the expression `a === b` evaluates to false as the data type of the two variables are different.}}
( ) true {{Incorrect because the expression `a === b` evaluates to false.}}
( ) The code above will throw an error because you cannot compare strings and numbers. {{Incorrect because different data types can be compared using the `==` and `===` operator.}}
( ) The code above will throw an error because there is a syntax error. {{Incorrect because there are no syntax errors in the code segment above.}}
( ) The code above will throw an error because the operator `===` cannot be used between variables with different data types. {{Incorrect because the `===` operator can be used to compare variables with different data types.}}

||The `==` operator compares the value while the `===` operator compares the value and data type.||
