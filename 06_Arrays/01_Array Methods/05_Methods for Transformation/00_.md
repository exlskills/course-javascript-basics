The array methods for transformation are also advanced methods that you do not need to memorize. The `filter()` and `map()` method returns a new array while the `reduce()` method returns a single object based on the function. You can either create a function beforehand and call it with the methods, or you can directly place the function in between the parenthesis. The syntax and the function of the three different methods are show below.

- `arrayname.filter(function)`
  - returns a new array
  - creates a new array where only the elements that meet the criteria in the function are stored
  - returns an empty array if none of the elements meet the criteria

- `arrayname.reduce(function,initial)`
  - returns an object, which is the result of the function

- `arrayname.map(function)`
  - returns a new array with the same size as the original array
  - each element of the array is changed in the new array, based on the function
