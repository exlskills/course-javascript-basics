# EXLskills JavaScript Basics Course

  This is the EXLskills free and open-source JavaScript Basics Course. It guides learners via explanation, demonstration, and thorough practice, from no more than a basic understanding of JavaScript, to a moderate level of essential coding proficiency. This course was created from Telerik Academy's [JavaScript Fundamentals Course](https://github.com/TelerikAcademy/JavaScript-Fundamentals) and has been converted to the EOCS format.

  ## Make Money by Sharing Your Skills

  Open source courseware contributions are absolutely critical to the success of the [EXLskills.com](https://exlskills.com) mission, yet we all have to keep the lights on... To this end, we offer a peer-to-peer instruction (tutoring-like) conversational interface that learners can use to have their questions answered by a certified EXLskills instructor. As a certified instructor, you choose your own hours, topics, and even your own rate! You can use the mobile instructor chat app (powered by Intercom) to answer questions on-the-go, or use the web application to go deep with learners via chat, screen share, and video!
