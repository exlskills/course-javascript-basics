# Divide by 7 and 5

## Description
Implement a javascript function that does the following:
  - Accepts an array containing a single integer number as string.
  - Stores in a variable if the number can be divided by 7 and 5 without remainder.
  - Prints on the console **"true NUMBER"** if the number is divisible without remainder by **7** and **5**. Otherwise prints **"false NUMBER"**.
   In place of **NUMBER** print the value of the input number.

## Input
- The input will consist of an array containing a single integer value as a string.

## Output
- The output must always follow the format specified in the description. See the sample tests.
- You can use `console.log` to print the results or you can use `return` to return the answer. Both are correct.

## Constraints
- The input will always consist of valid integers and follow the format in the description.
- Time limit: **0.2s**
- Memory limit: **16MB**
