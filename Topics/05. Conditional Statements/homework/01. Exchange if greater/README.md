### Problem 1. Exchange if greater
*	Write an `if` statement that takes two double variables `a` and `b` and exchanges their values if the first one is greater than the second.
*	As a result print the values `a` and `b`, separated by a space.

_Examples:_

| a    | b   | result  |
|------|-----|---------|
| 5    | 2   | 2 5     |
| 3    | 4   | 3 4     |
| 5.5  | 4.5 | 4.5 5.5 |
