### Problem 6. Quadratic equation
*	Write a script that reads the coefficients `a`, `b` and `c` of a quadratic equation ax<sup>2</sup> + bx + c = 0 and solves it (prints its real roots).
*	Calculates and prints its real roots.

_Note: Quadratic equations may have 0, 1 or 2 real roots._

_Examples:_

|   a  |  b  |  c  |     roots     |
|:----:|:---:|:---:|---------------|
| 2    | 5   | -3  | x1=-3; x2=0.5 |
| -1   | 3   | 0   | x1=3; x2=0    |
| -0.5 | 4   | -8  | x1=x2=4       |
| 5    | 2   | 8   | no real roots |
