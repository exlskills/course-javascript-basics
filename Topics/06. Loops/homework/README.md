# 01. Numbers from 1 to N

## Description
Implement a javascript function that accepts an array with a single element - positive integer **N** as string and prints all the numbers from **1** to **N** inclusive, on a single line, separated by a whitespace.

## Input
- The input will consist of an array with a single element - the number **N**.

## Output
- The output should consist of a single line - the numbers from **1** to **N**, separated by a whitespace.

## Constraints
- **N** will be a valid positive 32-bit integer
- Time limit: **0.2s**
- Memory limit: **16MB**

# 02. MMSA (Min, Max, Sum, Average) of N Numbers

## Description
Implement a javascript function that accepts an array of floating-point numbers as strings and returns the **minimal**, the **maximal** number, the **sum** 
and the **average** of all numbers (displayed with 2 digits after the decimal point).

## Input
- The array that will be passed as a parameter to your function will contain the numbers of the sequence.

## Output
- You output must always consist of *exactly* 4 lines - the minimal element on the first line, the maximal on the second, the sum on the third and the average on the fourth, in the following format:
```
min=3.00
max=6.00
sum=9.00
avg=4.50
```

## Constraints
- 1 <= **N** <= 1000
- All numbers will be valid floating-point numbers that will be in the range `[-10000, 10000]`
- Time limit: **0.2s**
- Memory limit: **32MB**

# 03. Matrix of Numbers

## Description
Write a javascript function that prints a matrix like in the examples below by a given integer **N**. Use two nested loops.
  - Challenge: _achieve the same effect without nested loops_.

## Input
- The input array will contain a single number as string, the integer **N**.

## Output
- See the examples.

## Constraints
- 1 <= **N** <= 20
- **N** will always be a valid integer number
- Time limit: **0.2s**
- Memory limit: **32MB**

# 04. Lexicographically smallest

## Description
- Write a script that finds the lexicographically smallest and largest property in `document`, `window` and `navigator` objects. Write the script in an external `.js` file and refer it from a html page.
- Execute the same script under `NodeJS`. Why does it crash?

## Submission
- You do not have to submit anything for this task.

# 05. Hex to Decimal

## Description
Using loops implement a javascript function that converts a hex number number to its decimal representation.

## Input
- The input will consists of a single line containing a single hexadecimal number as string.

## Output
- The output should consist of a single line - the decimal representation of the number as string.

## Constraints
- All numbers will be valid 64-bit integers.
- Time limit: **0.1s**
- Memory limit: **16MB**
