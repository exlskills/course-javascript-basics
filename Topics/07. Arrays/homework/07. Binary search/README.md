# Binary search

## Description
Write a program that finds the index of given element **X** in a sorted array of **N** integers by using the [Binary search](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_search_algorithm) algorithm.

## Input
- On the first line you will receive the number **N**
- On the next **N** lines the numbers of the array will be given
- On the last line you will receive the number **X**

## Output
- Print the index where **X** is in the array
  - If there is more than one occurence print the first one
  - If there are no occurences print `-1`

## Constraints
- 1 <= **N** <= 1024
- Time limit: **0.1s**
- Memory limit: **16MB**
