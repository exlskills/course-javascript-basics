# Group people

## Description
Write a function that groups an array of people by age.
The function must return an associative array, with keys - the groups, and values - arrays with people in this groups
Use function overloading (i.e. just one function)

_Example:_

```js
var people = [
  { firstname: 'Gosho', lastname: 'Petrov', age: 32 },
  { firstname: 'Bay', lastname: 'Ivan', age: 81 },
  { firstname: 'John', lastname: 'Doe', age: 42 },
  { firstname: 'Pesho', lastname: 'Pesho', age: 22 },
  { firstname: 'Asdf', lastname: 'Xyz', age: 81 },
  { firstname: 'Gosho', lastname: 'Gosho', age: 22 }
];

var groupedByAge = group(people);
```

- `groupedByAge` must be:
